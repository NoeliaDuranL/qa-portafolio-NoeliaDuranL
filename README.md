This repository showcases my first steps in Quality Assurance (QA) and Software Testing.  
It includes **manual testing** (using a site to that allows practice testing saucedemo) and **SQL testing** examples to demonstrate test case design, bug reporting, and database validation skills.

## ðŸ“‚ Contents

### 1. Manual Testing
- `saucedemo-test-cases.xlsx`: test cases for login, cart, and checkout features, using different users from saucedemo.
- `saucedemo-reports.md`: 4 bug reports (functional and usability issues) written in a standard template.

### 2. SQL Testing
- `sample-db.sql`: Example of a basic ecommerce database schema.
- `validation-queries.sql`: Positive and negative test queries to validate constraints (unique emails, invalid prices, foreign key violations).
- `validation-queries.md`: Documented findings with SQL errors and analysis. 
**I tried to insert some issues to my database example of ecommerce but it was not posible since the restrictions are violated, however I let the queries that I would use to test the DB.**
